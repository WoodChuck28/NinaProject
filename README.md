# NinaProject

Program designed to demonstrate the current defecits existing to our interstellar space program.

Program will eventually demonstrate both the ineffectiveness of a single atomic clock system while simultaneously demonstrating the ineffectiveness of our current atomic clock models. Proposing a multiple clock strategy while investigating the level of accuracy required for sustainable interstellar travel.


***USAGE***
Because of the massive difference in distances we will need to run code twice. First time we will modify the time interval to 1 day in seconds, comment out the big planets, change the file storage to /SolarSystem/ and then run. For the larger planets we change the time interval to 10 years in seconds, change the file storage to /BigDistances/ then comment out the small planets in our list (and allow big planets)
